# Ludo.ai art

The farm's art is being replaced, asset by asset, with images generated in [Ludo.ai](https://ludo.ai). These
scripts fit Ludo's images onto the game's 2:1 grid and write them into `public/assets/farm/` under the pack's
existing names, so the game code doesn't change. `source/` holds the Ludo images each asset was built from.

**`npm run art` regenerates the whole pack from `tools/art/` and overwrites these files.** Restore them from
git (or rerun the commands below) after running it.

## Generating in Ludo

Image Generator, Art Style **Cel-Shaded**, Perspective **Isometric**, Aspect Ratio **Square**. Image type
**Sprite** for buildings and props (transparent background), **Map Tile** for ground. Generate from
References with an approved asset as the reference, so the style stays the same. Winter versions: Edit Image
on the approved summer image. Ludo always draws a thick soil block under a pad or tile; the scripts cut it off.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/ludo-venv && /tmp/ludo-venv/bin/pip install -r tools/ludo/requirements.txt
```

## Buildings: `fit_building.py`

Cuts the soil block below the pad's top surface, optionally mirrors, scales the pad to the footprint (8 px
inset per side at 2x), and prints the anchor for `manifest.json`. Corners are the pad's top-surface left,
right and bottom corners, measured on the raw image (the extreme opaque columns give left and right).
Mirror when the door is on the wrong face: the farmhouse door must face +y (front-left), see `FARMHOUSE_DOOR`.

```bash
P=/tmp/ludo-venv/bin/python; L=tools/ludo
$P $L/fit_building.py $L/source/farmhouse_raw.png /tmp farmhouse 2 2 45 485 754 485 399.5 659 --mirror
$P $L/fit_building.py $L/source/farmhouse_winter_raw.png /tmp farmhouse_winter 2 2 57 609 967 609 512 834 --mirror --keep=-4
```

Copy `/tmp/2x_<name>.png` and `/tmp/1x_<name>.png` to `public/assets/farm/{2x,1x}/buildings/<name>.png` and
set the asset's `w`, `h`, `anchor` and `origin` (anchor / size) in `manifest.json`; drop its `shadow` (Ludo
draws the shadow on the pad). `--keep=N` is how many px below the pad's edge stay (default 2, the outline);
lower it if bits of the soil outline show.

## Props: `fit_prop.py`

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/props
for s in "" _spring _autumn _winter; do

```

BASE (`512 795` for the oak) is the point the prop stands on, measured on the raw image (the middle of the trunk's root flare);
it lands on the tile's centre. SCALE is raw px to 2x px. Generate the other seasons with Edit Image so they line up
with the summer image, and fit them all with the same BASE and SCALE. `--shadow=RX` bakes a soft oval shadow
under the base (Ludo draws none). `--leaves=HUE,SAT,VAL` recolours only the green pixels, for a season
Ludo needn't draw (the pine's spring and autumn). `install_prop.py` copies a fitted prop over its pack files and sets `w`, `h`, `anchor` and `origin` in
`manifest.json` (dropping `shadow`); extra names install the same image as other seasons. `--mirror` flips the
image, for a second variant from one Ludo image.

## Farmer: `fit_character.py`

Made in Directional Sprites: the Image Generator farmer (`farmer_raw.png`) as the character, Cartoon style, views
NE/SE/SW/NW at Isometric height, horizontal travel off; exported as an Animation Pack of Individual Frames
(`source/farmer_frames/`, one folder per sheet, numbered by Ludo; check each folder's direction by eye).

```bash
$P $L/fit_character.py $L/source/farmer_frames /tmp/props 100 \
  idle:se=Animation-1 idle:nw=Animation-2 idle:ne=Animation-3 idle:sw=Animation-6 \
  walk:nw=Animation-4 walk:sw=Animation-5 walk:ne=Animation-7 walk:se=Animation-8
```

`100` is his height in 2x px. Copy `/tmp/props/{2x,1x}_farmer.png` to `public/assets/farm/{2x,1x}/people/farmer.png`;
the manifest keeps the old layout (frame 164x156, anchor 82,126 at 2x; 82x78, anchor 41,63 at 1x) with no
`shadow`. Animations with no Ludo sheet yet (sit, plough, plant, harvest, build, feed) use the idle frames.

## Ground tiles: `ground_tiles.py`

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/tiles/2x /tmp/tiles/1x
$P $L/ground_tiles.py /tmp/tiles $L/source/grass_a_raw.png $L/source/grass_b_raw.png $L/source/dirt_raw.png \
  $L/source/soil_raw.png $L/source/snow_raw.png $L/source/snow_path_raw.png
```

Takes the inside of each Ludo tile (no outline, no edge tufts), un-shears it to a square, flattens its lighting
and makes it wrap, then renders every tile in tile space so all of them meet without seams. The grass variants
share one border. Paths and soil beds keep the shapes from `tools/art/tiles.py`; `soil_*_y` is `soil_*_x` with
the furrows turned; watered soil is tilled soil darkened; unowned land is the grass darkened and muted. Sizes
and anchors match the pack, so `manifest.json` needs no change. It writes every season's file (base, `_spring`,
`_summer`, `_autumn`, `_winter`); copy them all into `public/assets/farm/{2x,1x}/tiles/`.

Seasons: spring and summer are the Ludo grass as is. Autumn is it recoloured gold with fallen leaves drawn on
(wrapped, so it still tiles). Winter uses the snow tile for grass (three variants: as is, turned, transposed),
the trampled-snow tile for paths, and frozen soil: the tilled soil greyed with snow in the furrows.
