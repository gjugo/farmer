# farmer

A cheerful 2D farming game for the browser, built with **Phaser 4**, **Vite** and **TypeScript**.
Grow the farm, build fields and pastures, raise animals, turn crops and animal products into
milk, cheese, eggs and more, and sell them to expand.

## Running it

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev                          # http://localhost:5173
npm run dev -- --port 5243 --strictPort
```

| Script              | What it does                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Vite dev server with hot reload                |
| `npm run build`     | Typecheck and production build into `dist/`    |
| `npm run preview`   | Serve the production build                     |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` (strict)                        |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint                                         |
| `npm test`          | Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts`)         |
| `npm run art`       | Regenerate `public/assets/farm/` from its Python source ([tools/art](tools/art/README.md); needs Python 3.12+ and cairo, not part of CI) |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm ci`, typecheck, lint, test and build on every PR and on `main`.

### Controls

- **Pan:** drag the map, or WASD / arrow keys. **Zoom:** mouse wheel or pinch.
- **Build:** 🔨 Build → pick an item → click/tap a tile. A green ghost means the spot is valid.
  Esc, right-click or **Cancel** leaves build mode.
- **Demolish:** 🧹 → click an object (refunds 50% of its cost).
- Click an object to open its action panel.
- **Animals:** build a Chicken Coop or Pasture, open it to buy animals and feed. Fed animals produce
  after their cycle; click the pen (or **Collect**) to pick up eggs, milk and wool.
- **Processing:** build a Feed Mill, Dairy, Bakery or Loom, open it and pick a recipe. Inputs are taken at once;
  up to 3 jobs queue and run one at a time. Click the building (or **Collect**) to pick up finished goods.
- **Orders:** 📋 Orders shows 3 customer orders for goods you have had before. Fulfil hands over the goods
  for a reward above today's market value; the HUD badge counts orders you can fulfil now. A fulfilled slot
  gets a new order after 2 game-minutes, a discarded one after 5.
- **Crops:** tap an empty field → pick wheat, carrot or corn (paid in money). Tap a growing field for
  its progress; tap a ripe (swaying, sparkling) field to harvest into the inventory.
- **Sound:** starts on the first click/tap (browser autoplay rules). 🔊 in the HUD mutes everything; ⚙️ Settings has
  Music and Effects sliders, a mute switch and the audio Credits. Sound settings are kept in localStorage
  (`farmer.audio`), not in the save. Music and the ambience pause while the tab is hidden.

### Debug mode (QA)

Open `/?debug=1` for a panel with **+$1000**, **+10 of any item**, clock speed **×1 / ×10 / ×60** and
**Refresh orders** (fills every order slot now).
`window.farm` always returns a frozen, read-only snapshot of the game state (plus `day`), e.g.
`window.farm.money`, `window.farm.inventory`, `window.farm.objects`. `window.farm.orders` holds the
orders board: `known` goods and `slots[i]` (`order: { customer, items: [{ itemId, qty }], reward }` or
`refill: { start, duration }` with `reason: 'fulfilled' | 'discarded'`).
`window.farm.iso.tileToScreen(x, y)` returns the page pixel of tile (x, y)'s centre at the current camera, so a
script can click a known tile (`page.mouse.click(p.x, p.y)`). Browsers report mouse positions in whole CSS pixels,
so to click "just inside" an edge, stay at least 2 px inside it.
`window.farm.audio` is `{ muted, musicVolume, sfxVolume, lastPlayed }`, where `lastPlayed` lists the last 20 sound
keys played (e.g. `plant`, `coins`, `levelup`, `cluck`), so you can check which sounds fire without hearing them.

## Extending the game

Features live in `src/features/<name>/index.ts`. Every such file is imported automatically
(`import.meta.glob` in `src/features/index.ts`), and registers what it needs as a side effect.
**A new feature should not need to edit any shared file**, so parallel work rarely conflicts.

### Add an item

Items are shared ids, so they live in one place: add an entry to `ITEMS` in `src/data/items.ts`
(`id`, `name`, `category`, base sell `price`, emoji `icon`). Use the id everywhere else; give it a pack icon
in `public/assets/farm/*/icons/<id>.png` and list it in `ICON_ART` (`src/scenes/art.ts`), and its emoji in any
label shows as that icon
(`game.addItem('egg', 3)`, `game.count('milk')`).

### Add a buildable

```ts
// src/features/coop/index.ts
import { registerBuildable } from '../../data/buildables';
import { registerBehavior } from '../../game/hooks';
import { startTimer, timerDone, timerProgress, type Timer } from '../../logic/clock';

interface CoopState { hens: number; timer: Timer | null }

// `texture` is a sprite of the art pack (public/assets/farm/manifest.json), or a game key mapped to one in
// TEXTURE_ART (src/scenes/art.ts). It is drawn anchored on the footprint's top corner, with its shadow.
registerBuildable({
  id: 'coop',
  name: 'Chicken coop',
  cost: 120,
  footprint: { w: 3, h: 3 }, // the sprite's footprint in the manifest
  texture: 'chicken_coop',
  category: 'animals',
  initialState: (): CoopState => ({ hens: 0, timer: null }), // also fills old saves
});

registerBehavior<CoopState>('coop', {
  create(ctx, obj, view) { /* add sprites to view.container */ },
  update(ctx, obj, view, gameDt) { /* animate; runs every frame */ },
  refresh(ctx, obj, view) { /* obj.state changed: update the view */ },
  panel: (ctx, obj) => ({
    title: 'Chicken coop',
    icon: '🐔',
    lines: [`Hens: ${obj.state.hens}`],
    progress: obj.state.timer ? { value: timerProgress(ctx.game.state.clock, obj.state.timer) } : undefined,
    actions: [
      {
        label: 'Collect eggs',
        disabled: !obj.state.timer || !timerDone(ctx.game.state.clock, obj.state.timer),
        onClick: () => {
          ctx.game.addItem('egg', obj.state.hens);
          obj.state.timer = startTimer(ctx.game.state.clock, 60_000);
          ctx.game.touch(obj); // announce the state change
          ctx.ui.floatText(obj.x, obj.y, `+${obj.state.hens} 🥚`);
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

The build menu, ghost preview, placement rules, charging, demolish refunds, saving and the
action panel all come for free. A "Demolish" action is appended to every object panel.

### Add a timer

Never use `setTimeout`, `setInterval` or `Date.now()` for gameplay. Store a `Timer`
(`startTimer(clock, durationMs)`) in the object's state and read it with `timerProgress`,
`timerRemaining` and `timerDone`. Timers run on game time, so they survive save/load and
speed up with the debug clock speed. `game.now` is the current game time in ms;
1 day = 4 real minutes at ×1 (`DAY_MS`). Subscribe to `game.events.on('day', ...)` for daily
events. There is no offline progress: time only passes while the game is open.

### Other extension points

- **HUD button** (e.g. Market): `registerHudButton({ id, label, icon, onClick: (ctx) => ctx.ui.openPanel(...) })`.
  Add `badge: (ctx) => n` to show a count on the button (hidden at 0).
- **Global feature state** (e.g. market prices): `registerStateSlice('market', () => ({ ... }))`
  and `getSlice(game.state, 'market')`. Defaults are merged into old saves.
- **Custom sheet** (markup of your own, like the Market): `ctx.ui.toggleSheet({ id, title, signature, render, tick })`.
- **Confirm dialog:** `await ctx.ui.confirm(title, message, { confirmLabel, variant, disabled, hint })`.
- **Taps on empty tiles** (e.g. locked land): `registerTileTapHandler((ctx, x, y) => true /* handled */)`.
- **Selling:** `sell(game, itemId, qty?)` / `dailyPrice(game.day, itemId)` from `src/logic/market.ts`.
- **Feedback:** `ctx.ui.toast(msg, 'success' | 'error')`, `ctx.ui.floatText(tileX, tileY, text)`.
  Money changes float next to the money counter automatically.
- **Events:** `game.events.on('money' | 'inventory' | 'objectAdded' | 'objectRemoved' | 'objectChanged' | 'land' | 'day' | 'speed' | 'reset', fn)`.
- **Land:** `game.setLandOwned(x, y, true)` repaints tiles and fences.
- **Startup logic:** `onGameStart((ctx) => { ... })`.
- **New-game content:** `onNewGame((state) => addStartingObject(state, 'field', x, y))` from
  `src/logic/state.ts` (runs only for brand-new farms, not loaded saves).

## Save data

Autosaved to `localStorage` (`farmer.save`) every 10 s and when the tab is hidden or closed.
Saves are versioned (`SAVE_VERSION` in `src/logic/save.ts`). Missing fields fall back to
defaults, so adding state needs no migration; restructuring does (add one to `migrations`).
Settings → **New game** resets the farm after a confirmation.

## Art

The isometric farm pack in `public/assets/farm/` (its `README.md` and `manifest.json`; licence in
CREDITS.md). The 2x set is loaded and drawn at half scale, so one world pixel is one 1x pack pixel and a tile
is 128 × 64. `src/scenes/art.ts` maps the game's texture keys to pack sprites; anchors come from the manifest.
Only speech bubbles, sparkles and smoke are drawn at runtime. Emoji remain only where the pack has no icon
(animals, buildings, HUD buttons).

The pack is generated by Python code in [`tools/art/`](tools/art/README.md): `npm run art` rebuilds it into
`public/assets/farm/`. New crops, animals and buildings get their art there, in the same style; its README
has setup steps and a worked example.
